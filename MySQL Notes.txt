KEYS

A KEY is a value used to identify a record in a table uniquely. 
A KEY could be a single column or combination of multiple columns.

Primary Key - is a single column value used to identify a database record uniquely.
- A primary key cannot be NULL
- A primary key value must be unique
- The primary key values should rarely be changed
- The primary key must be given a value when a new record is inserted.

Composite Key - is a primary key composed of multiple columns used to identify a record uniquely.

Foreign Key -  references the primary key of another Table! It helps connect your Tables.
- A foreign key can have a different name from its primary key
- It ensures rows in one table have corresponding rows in another
- Unlike the Primary key, they do not have to be unique. Most often they aren't
- Foreign keys can be null even though primary keys can not 

NORMALIZATION RULES

* 1st normal form - one value per field - split into extra columns and rows

* 2nd normal form - single column primary key - "there can only be one" extra repeating rows go in separate table

* 3rd normal form - fields depend only on primary key - data repeated in a column go in separate table

1NF (First Normal Form) Rules
- Each table cell should contain a single value.
- Each record needs to be unique.

2NF (Second Normal Form) Rules
- Rule 1- Be in 1NF
- Rule 2- Single Column Primary Key

3NF (Third Normal Form) Rules
- Rule 1- Be in 2NF
- Rule 2- Has no transitive functional dependencies

3.5 Normal Form BCNF, 4NF, 5NF and 6NF are rarely used.

Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) Model
- is a high level data model which provides extensions to original Entity Relationship (ER) model. 
- supports more details design. 
- emerged as a solution for modeling highly complex databases.

EER uses UML notation
- UML is the acronym for Unified Modeling Language; it is a general purpose modeling language used when designing object oriented systems. 
- Entities are represented as class diagrams. 
- Relationships are represented as associations between entities. 
- The diagram shown below illustrates an ER diagram using the UML notation.

ER DIAGRAMS
- ER Diagrams play a very important role in the database designing process. 
- They serve as a non-technical communication tool for technical and non-technical people.
- Entities represent real world things; they can be conceptual as a sales order or physical such as a customer.
- All entities must be given unique names.
- ER models also allow the database designers to identify and define the relations that exist among entities.

CREATE EER MODEL USING MySQL Workbench

Click - "+" Button
a. Double click on Add Diagram button to open the workspace for ER diagrams.
b. The table object allows us to create entities and define the attributes associated with the particular entity.
c. The place relationship button allows us to define relationships between entities.

# Create the members table
1.Drag the table object from the tools panel
2.Drop it in the workspace area. An entity named table 1 appears
3.Double click on it. The properties window shown below appears
4. Change table 1 to Members
5. Edit the default idtable1 to membership_number
6. Click on the next line to add the next field
7. Do the same for all the attributes identified in members' entity.
8. Repeat the above steps for all the identified entities.

# Create relationship between Members and Movie Rentals
9. Select the place relationship using existing columns too
10. Click on membership_number in the Members table
11. Click on reference_number in the MovieRentals table
12. Repeat above steps for other relationships.

MySQL Create Database, Tables, Data Types
Steps for Create Database Mysql

# Create Database Mysql - USING THE QUERY METHOD
Start
CREATE DATABASE is the SQL command for creating a database. example: CREATE DATABASE movies;
Note: you can also use the command CREATE SCHEMA instead of CREATE DATABASE
IF NOT EXISTS let you to instruct MySQL server to check the existence of a database with a similar name prior to creating database.
example: CREATE DATABASEIF NOT EXISTS movies;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS movies CHARACTER SET utf8-general-ci
SHOW DATABASES
CREATE  TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] `TableName` (`fieldname` dataType [optional parameters]) ENGINE = storage Engine; 
End

example:

CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `MyFlixDB`.`Members` (
  `membership_number` INT  AUTOINCREMENT ,
  `full_names` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL ,
  `gender` VARCHAR(6) ,
  `date_of_birth` DATE ,
  `physical_address` VARCHAR(255) ,
  `postal_address` VARCHAR(255) ,
  `contact_number` VARCHAR(75) ,
  `email` VARCHAR(255) ,
  PRIMARY KEY (`membership_number`) )
ENGINE = InnoDB;

Best practices
- Use upper case letters for SQL keywords i.e. "DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS `MyFlixDB`;"
- End all your SQL commands using semi colons.
- Avoid using spaces in schema, table and field names. Use underscores instead to separate schema, table or field names.

# Create Database Mysql - USING THE ER DIAGRAM FORWARD ENGINEERING METHOD
Start
1. Open the ER model of MyFlix database that you created in earlier tutorial.
2. Click on the database menu. 
3. Select forward engineer
4. The next window,  allows you to connect to an instance of MySQL server. 
5. Click on the stored connection drop down list and select local host. 
6. Click Execute
7. Select the options shown below in the wizard that appears. DROP OBJECTS.., GENERATE DROP.., INCLUDE MODEL..
8. Click next
9. The next screen shows the summary of objects in our EER diagram. Our MyFlix DB has 5 tables.  Keep the selections default and click Next.
10. The next window allows you to preview the SQL script to create our database. We can save the scripts to a *.sql" file or copy the scripts to the clipboard. Click on next button
11. The next window appears after successfully creating the database on the selected MySQL server instance.
End
